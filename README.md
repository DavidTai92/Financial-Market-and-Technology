In this assignment, I am tasked to create a trading strategy (Brent against WTI) using MS Excel.

To develop the "pairs" trading strategy:
- I have pulled out 3 years of historical data
- Find the correlation relation
- Identify potential trade decisions when the differential reaches 5th / 95th percentile
- Exit when it reverts back to the mean; or when stop loss is triggered

I have also created a summary of the report findings for better visualization.
